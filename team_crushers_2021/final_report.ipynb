    "The main goal of this project was to examine if the GameStop Rally has a widespread effect on the stock market, looking specifically at the highly-shorted firms in the Russell 2000 index. We found each firm's overperformance, or alpha, during the pre-Rally period of 2020 and during the GameStop Rally of January and February 2021. We then analyzed cross-correlations of these alphas along with the level of short interest for the combination of firms. Lastly, we used a Difference in Differences (DiD) and various plots to see if our results were significant enough to draw conclusions on whether or not the GameStop Rally had an effect on firms with high short interest."

    "Why is this topic interesting? One of the greatest questions facing the finance industry today is what will be the impact of the “democratization” of finance. Yes, this is a common buzzword whose meaning has been rendered almost meaningless due to excessive use. But the theme of investing being more readily available to a wide group of people is certainly real. Everyone has a smartphone that can download a multitude of brokerage apps. Almost all brokerage firms have cut trading fees to zero, allowing anyone to “day-trade” even with minimal starting capital. And almost anything you could ever want to know about the stock market can be found online. "

    "The GameStop Rally in early 2021 was one of the first examples of retail traders taking advantage of this new investing paradigm. A few savvy members of the reddit forum r/WallStreetBets discovered that there was a huge amount of short interest surrounding GameStop. This, combined with fundamental factors like the activist stake taken by notable investor Ryan Cohen, led to a bull thesis that was amplified by the Internet forum. Soon, GameStop’s stock price would reach astronomical levels as investors piled in. A popular trading platform named Robinhood would have to suspend trading and raise capital to deal with the increased activity around GameStop."

This is essentially an extension of the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM). Using this data should allow us to get more in-depth results.

We then plotted the daily alpha for each firm during the Rally period. The resulting data points were mostly evenly distributed across low, medium, and high. There were quite a few more outliers in the “medium” and “high” short level groups.

Added to the dataset was the short-interest for both firm 1 and firm 2. The last column in the dataset was “Int Level > 0.50” which would return true only if BOTH firms had a short interest over 0.50. This allowed us to create a “treated” category that contained entries where both firms had a relatively high amount of short interest. This “treated” dataset was split further into the pre-Rally period and the during-Rally period. This was done again for correlations that did not breach the 0.50 short interest threshold.

The correlations between high short interest and low short interest were very similar. But the correlations pre-Rally and during-Rally were noticeably different. While correlations peaked at around 0.15 for both, the during-Rally correlations had a visibly higher kurtosis. This leads us to believe that the GameStop Rally led to higher volatility in alpha correlations. "
