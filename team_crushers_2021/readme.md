# "When Markets Invert: The GameStop Effect"
Alina Lam, Luke Resnick, Julio Veracruz

### PURPOSE
The main purpose of this project was to determine what effect the GameStop saga had on other heavily shorted stocks. If we could answer this specific question, we could get a better idea of what the answer to our "big" questions were. We wanted to know how broken are the markets? And is the influx of retail investors leading to a possible bubble? In this project we attempted to determine the impact of the GameStop rally. We did this through calculating the alpha correlations among firms in the Russell 2000 index, and then seeing how these changed based on the levels of short interest. Our conclusions can be found below.
